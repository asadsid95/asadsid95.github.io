# maps_travel

A platform to connect with your friends and together, fill the world's map with your already-visited countries.

Who knows? One day, your group may need to think of a country to travel together to. You will no longer need to figure out where no one has visited before.

Simply run the app and boom, you'll find the country to visit!
